    <string name="lyrics">I used to rule the world\nSeas would rise when I gave the word\nNow in the morning I sleep alone\nSweep the streets I used to own\n\nI used to roll the dice\nFeel the fear in my enemy\'s eyes\nListen as the crowd would sing,\n"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"\n\nOne minute I held the key\nNext the walls were closed on me\nAnd I discovered that my castles stand\nUpon pillars of salt and pillars of sand\n\nI hear Jerusalem bells are ringing\nRoman Cavalry choirs are singing\nBe my mirror, my sword and shield\nMy missionaries in a foreign field\n\nFor some reason I can\'t explain\nOnce you go there was never\nNever an honest word\nAnd that was when I ruled the world\n\nIt was the wicked and wild wind\nBlew down the doors to let me in\nShattered windows and the sound of drums\nPeople couldn\'t believe what I\'d become\n\nRevolutionaries wait\nFor my head on a silver plate\nJust a puppet on a lonely string\nOh, who would ever wanna be king?\n\nI hear Jerusalem bells are ringing\nRoman Cavalry choirs are singing\nBe my mirror, my sword and shield\nMy missionaries in a foreign field\n\nFor some reason I can\'t explain\nI know Saint Peter won\'t call my name\nNever an honest word\nBut that was when I ruled the world\n\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh\n\nI hear Jerusalem bells are ringing\nRoman Cavalry choirs are singing\nBe my mirror, my sword and shield\nMy missionaries in a foreign field\n\nFor some reason I can\'t explain\nI know Saint Peter won\'t call my name\nNever an honest word\nBut that was when I ruled the world</string>
